    <h1>Early Years</h1>

    <p>Opeth was formed as a death metal band in the autumn of 1990 in Stockholm, Sweden by vocalist David Isberg. Isberg asked former Eruption band member Mikael Åkerfeldt (just 16 years old at the time) to join Opeth as a bassist. When Åkerfeldt showed up to practice the day after Isberg invited him, it became clear that Isberg had not told the band members, including the band's current bassist, that Åkerfeldt would be joining. An ensuing argument led to all members but Isberg and Åkerfeldt leaving to form a new project. The band name was derived from the word "Opet," taken from the Wilbur Smith novel The Sunbird. In this novel, Opet is the name of a fictional Phoenician city in South Africa whose name is translated as "City of the Moon". </p>

    <h1>Trivia</h1>

<div class="trivia">

    <ul>
        <li>The only single from the album "Ghost Reveries" is "The Grand Conjuration". A music video of the song was released, although about half of the song was edited from the video, due to the length of the song. Drummer Martin Lopez does not appear in the video, as he was sick and was temporarily replaced by Gene Hoglan.</li>
        <li>The song Ghost of Perdition is featured in the soundtrack of the video game Saints Row 2. It can be heard on the radio station "Krunch 106.66".</li>    
        <li>Contrary to popular belief, Mikael Åkerfeldt isn't one the founding members of Opeth. He joined Opeth in the same year of its formation (1990) as a bass player.</li>
        <li>Mikael Åkerfeldt is the inspiration for the design of Toki Wartooth, rhythm guitarist in the cartoon band Dethklok.</li>
        <li>The track "For Absent Friends" on the album "Deliverance" was named after a song of the same name, originally appearing on the album Nursery Cryme by progressive rock group Genesis.</li>
        <li>The song "The Night and the Silent Water" is about the grandfather of Mikael Åkerfeldt who had died shortly before the recording of the album.</li>
